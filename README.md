## Next Steps

Automated Alerts: Integrate with a notification system to automatically alert the Operations team when a supplierâ€™s risk score crosses a predefined threshold.

Advanced Risk Factors: Expand the risk model to include additional factors like supplier financial health, contract compliance, and external market conditions.

Real-Time Data Integration: Incorporate real-time data feeds to continuously update supplier performance metrics and provide dynamic, up-to-date risk assessments.

User Interface: Build a simple dashboard in Power BI for to visualise supplier risk scores in a user-friendly interface, making it easier for Tim et al to act on the data.
