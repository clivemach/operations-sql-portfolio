# Supplier Risk Monitoring

## Project Overview

This project simulates how an Operations Manager could use SQL to monitor supplier performance and identify early warning signs of risk.

By analyzing metrics such as:
- **On-time delivery rates**
- **Order accuracy rates**
- **Quality compliance rates**

We generate a **risk score** for each supplier and identify suppliers that may require intervention.

## Files Included
- `create_tables.sql` — Sets up the database schema.
- `insert_sample_data.sql` — Populates the database with example supplier performance data.
- `supplier_risk_query.sql` — Queries the database to identify high-risk suppliers based on defined thresholds.

## Technologies Used
- PostgreSQL
- SQL

## Notes
- Supplier data is redacted for confidentiality.
- Risk scoring logic can be adapted to suit different industries and operational environments.
